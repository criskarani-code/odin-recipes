<p class="caption">Kenyan Pilau is an aromatic, one-pot spiced rice dish central to Swahili culture and a staple at celebrations.</p><p class="caption">The secret to an authentic dark brown pilau lies in caramelizing the onions—not the spices—until they are deep golden brown. </p>
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul class="ul">
    <li><em>Meat:</em> 500g beef (sirloin or bone-in) or goat meat, cubed.</li>
    <li><em>Rice:</em> 2 cups long-grain Basmati or Pishori rice.</li>
    <li><em>Aromatics:</em> 2–3 large red onions (thinly sliced), 1 tbsp minced ginger, and 4–5 cloves of minced garlic.</li>
    <li><em>Spices (Pilau Masala):</em> You can use 2 tbsp of store-bought "Pilau Masala" or a whole spice mix including 1 tbsp cumin seeds, 1 cinnamon stick, 5–8 cardamom pods, 5–8 whole cloves, and 1 tsp black peppercorns.</li>
    <li><em>Vegetables (Optional):</em> 3 medium potatoes, peeled and quartered.</li>
    <li><em>Liquid:</em> 4 cups of beef broth (reserved from boiling the meat) or water.</li>
    <li><em>Oil:</em> ¼ cup vegetable oil or ghee. </li>
    <li><em>Salt:</em> To taste.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Preparation Steps:</h3>
<ol class="ol">
    <li><em>Boil the Meat:</em> Place the meat in a pot with a little salt, garlic, and ginger. Cover with water and simmer until tender. Drain and reserve the stock (broth) for cooking the rice later.</li>
    <li><em>Caramelize Onions:</em> In a large heavy-based pot (sufuria), heat oil over medium-high heat. Add sliced onions and fry for 10–15 minutes until they are a deep, dark brown. Do not burn them, as this will make the rice bitter.</li>
    <li><em>Add Aromatics & Spices:</em> Stir in the minced garlic, ginger, and your pilau masala spices (whole or ground). Sauté for 1–2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
    <li><em>Brown the Meat & Potatoes:</em> Add the pre-boiled meat and potatoes (if using). Stir well for 5 minutes so the meat absorbs the spice flavors and browns slightly.</li>
    <li><em>Simmer with Rice:</em> Add the washed rice to the pot and stir for 2 minutes to coat it in the oil and spices. Pour in the reserved meat stock (standard ratio is 2 parts liquid to 1 part rice).</li>
    <li><em>Cook & Steam:</em> Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to the lowest setting. Cover tightly (using aluminum foil under the lid helps trap steam) and cook for 15–20 minutes until all liquid is absorbed.</li>
    <li><em>Rest & Serve:</em> Turn off the heat and let the rice sit covered for 5–10 minutes. Fluff gently with a fork and serve with Kachumbari (a fresh tomato and onion salad).</li></ol>
