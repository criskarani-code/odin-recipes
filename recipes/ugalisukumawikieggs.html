<p>This is a classic Kenyan staple, often called the "Bachelor's Special." It is affordable, nutritious, and quick to make.</p>

<p>To prepare Kenyan ugali, sukuma wiki, and scrambled eggs, you will first cook the ugali in a pot, then the sukuma wiki in one pan, and finally the scrambled eggs in another.</p><p>The total preparation and cooking time for the meal is approximately 30 minutes.</p> 
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<h5>For the Ugali:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups maize meal (white cornmeal)</li>
    <li>4 cups water</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
</ul> 
<h5>For the Sukuma Wiki:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>1 bunch collard greens (sukuma wiki), chopped</li>
    <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
    <li>2 large tomatoes, diced</li>
    <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
Optional:<em> 2 cloves garlic, minced; pinch of cinnamon, ginger, or turmeric powder </em>
<h5>For the Scrambled Eggs:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>3 eggs</li>
    <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil or butter</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>Optional: 1 small onion, chopped</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ul>
    <li><h5>Step 1: Prepare the Ugali</h5> 
<ol>
    <li><strong><em>Boil the water:</em></strong> In a large pot, bring 4 cups of salted water to a rolling boil over medium-high heat.</li>
    <li><strong><em>Add cornmeal:</em></strong> Gradually add the maize meal, stirring continuously with a wooden spoon or spatula (<em>locally called a mwiko</em>) to avoid lumps.</li>
    <li><strong><em>Cook the ugali:</em></strong> Reduce the heat to medium-low and continue stirring until the mixture thickens and forms a stiff paste or dough.</li>
    <li><strong><em>Finish:</em></strong> Gather the ugali into a mound in the center of the pot and let it cook for an additional two minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.</li> 
</ol></li>
<li><h5>Step 2: Cook the Sukuma Wiki</h5> 
    <ol>
        <li><strong><em>Sauté aromatics:</em></strong> Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a separate pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened and golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong><em>Add tomatoes:</em></strong> Stir in the diced tomatoes and cook until they break down and soften, about 5 minutes. If using garlic or spices, add them now and cook for another minute.</li>
        <li><strong><em>Cook greens:</em></strong> Add the chopped collard greens (<em>sukuma wiki</em>) and stir well to incorporate with the tomato mixture.</li>
        <li><strong><em>Simmer:</em></strong> Cover the pan and let the greens steam and cook for about 5-6 minutes, or until tender. Season with salt and pepper to taste, then remove from heat and set aside.</li>
    </ol></li>
<li><h5>Step 3: Scramble the Eggs</h5>
     <ol>
        <li><strong><em>Heat pan:</em></strong> In a third, smaller skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of oil or butter over medium heat.</li>
        <li><strong><em>Scramble eggs:</em></strong> Beat the eggs in a small bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper. Pour the beaten eggs into the hot skillet. As the edges set, gently pull the cooked egg towards the center with a spatula to create a fluffy texture.<p> Cook until just set but still moist, as they will continue to cook off the heat.</p></ol> 
<li><h5>Step 4: Serve</h5> 
    <ol>
        <li><strong><em>Plate:</em></strong> Serve the hot ugali as a mound on a plate, with generous sides of the sukuma wiki and scrambled eggs.</li>
        <li><strong><em>Garnish:</em></strong> Garnish with fresh lemon wedges for squeezing over the dish, if desired.</li></ol></ul>

<h3>Serving</h3>
<P>Place a portion of ugali on a plate, add a generous serving of sukuma wiki next to it, and the scrambled eggs on the side. This is traditionally eaten by hand by pinching a piece of ugali, making a small indentation, and using it to scoop up the greens and eggs.</P>

<P><strong><em>Enjoy your Kenyan meal!</em></strong></P>
