<p>Githeri is a simple, nutritious Kenyan one-pot meal consisting of boiled maize (corn) and beans, originating from the Kikuyu community.</p><p> While modern variations often include spices and vegetables, the traditional method focuses on the natural flavor of the maize and beans.</p> 
<p>Here is a traditional, straightforward recipe for Githeri:</p>
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 kg Beans: Traditionally red kidney beans, rose cocoa, or pinto beans, pre-boiled until tender.</li>
    <li>5 Ears of Fresh Maize/Corn: Removed from the cob (or 2 cups dried maize, soaked overnight and pre-boiled).</li>
    <li>2 Onions: Finely chopped.</li>
    <li>2 Tomatoes: Chopped (optional, but commonly used for a little sauce).</li>
    <li>1 Tablespoon Oil or Fat: (e.g., vegetable oil).</li>
    <li>Salt: To taste.</li>
  
</ul>
<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>If using dry ingredients, soak the beans and maize overnight.</li>
    <li>Boil the beans and maize together in a large pot with plenty of water until both are soft. (<em>this can take 1–3 hours</em>).</li>
    <li>Drain any excess water once cooked.</li>
    <li>Heat the oil in a large pot or sufuria.</li>
    <li>Add the chopped onions and sauté over medium heat until they are soft and translucent.</li>
    <li>Add the tomatoes and cook until they are soft and form a paste.</li>
    <li>Add the boiled maize and beans to the pot with the fried onions and tomatoes.</li>
    <li>Add salt, mixing well to ensure the flavors are distributed evenly.</li>
    <li>Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer for 10–15 minutes to allow the flavors to blend.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Serve:</h3>
    <p><em>Serve hot.</em> Traditionally, it is accompanied by avocado or tea. </p>
    <p><strong><em>Enjoy your traditional Kenyan Githeri!</em></strong></p>
