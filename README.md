# odin-recipes 

this is a project about building a recipes website.
the objective is to showcase my 'new found' beginner HTML and github skills.

skills showcased: 1. filling of boilerplate html, 2. working with text, 3. html comments, 4. lists, 5. working with links and images, 6. git workflow

this website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

PS: this will not be pretty.
